# webScraping-seed
Assuming you have a Java IDE and the latest JDK, this will get you started with a basic webScrape using Java, Selenium, and Chromedriver.
All the needed libraries are in the lib folder.  After cloning or downloading the seed, just add everthing from the lib folder to the
libraries for the project.  That should take care of all the initial errors.

Next, you will have to specify the path to chromedriver.exe.  This will be the path to the project followed by /lib/chromedriver.exe.

Then you are ready to run the project.  It will loop through the urlArray and output the education info (found on city-data.com) to 
the console for each of the five cities.
