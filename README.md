# webScraping-seed
Assuming you have a Java IDE and the latest JDK, this will get you started with a basic webScrape using Java, Selenium, and Chromedriver.
All the needed libraries are in the lib folder.  After cloning or downloading the seed, just add everthing from the lib folder to the
libraries for the project.  That should take care of all the initial errors.  Running the project will open a new chrome window that
navigates to the starting URL, pause, then close the browser.
